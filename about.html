            I was born and raised in Hawaii and spent most of my childhood there.  When I was a kid I played a variety of sports and spent a lot of time at the beach.  I also really liked to fish and some of my best memories as a kid was going out on the ocean with my friend in his 10 foot dingy and 2.5hp motor, trolling around the island.  We would never really catch that much but always had a blast and when the fishing wasn't good we would take our surf boards and check out breaks nearby.

            After graduating highschool, I moved to southern California to do my undergrad at UC Irvine.  During my time in college, I studied abroad in Singapore and traveled quite a bit over the summers.  One of my favorite trips was when I went up to Whister Canada with a couple friends and snowboarded for a week.  I also picked up snowboarding in southern California and ended up getting a pass at Big Bear mountain.  After spending 3 years in Irvine, I decided to move back to Hawaii and continue school back at home since I wasn't the biggest fan of socal.  I spent about 2 years back at home going to University of Hawaii and then ended up moving back to California again, this time to San Francisco.  I have been here for about a year and a half and really enjoy it so far.  Spent the first 16 month working at a beer company called Hopsy, and ended up quitting that to start this coding bootcamp!
